# Docker install on Raspberry Pi 5

This repository serves as a place to contain a fully automated script that lets you install docker engine on your Raspberry Pi.
Because the OS on the Pi is based on Debian, this script can also be used to install docker on a Debian host.

**Note:** All the commands used in the script are based off of the official guide on how to install docker which can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
**Note:** The script will need sudo priviledges to run, otherwise it will abort the installation.
**Note:** In order to run the script, either give it execution permission with ```chmod +x``` or run it using the ```bash``` command.
